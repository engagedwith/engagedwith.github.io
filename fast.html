              <span class="bold-it">Objectives:</span> Families and Schools Together (FAST) for Kindergartners is the parent involvement and family engagement strategy used in 60 Title I-eligible schools in Philadelphia. The purpose of FAST is to increase parent social support, improve parent-child relationships, and increase positive family-school engagement – ultimately placing children on a better path for success in school. FAST is an evidence-based family skills program developed in 1988 that currently operates in 18 countries and 50 states. FAST for Kindergartners works by using principles of experiential learning (not lecturing) that are proven to develop healthy behaviors, build social support, and foster a nurturing environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the leadership of the Wisconsin Center for Education Research (WCER), The School District of Philadelphia (SDP) Offices of Research and Evaluation (ORE) and Early Childhood Education (ECE), Turning Points for Children (TPC), Families and Schools Together (FAST), and American Institutes for Research (AIR) partnered in the development of the I3 proposal to fund the implementation of FAST in Philadelphia in the 2013-2014 school year. 
            </p>
              <span class="bold-it">Theoretical Framework:</span> FAST groups are based on theories from sociology and psychology and on Paulo Freire’s strategy of empowering a collective parent voice. Further, FAST expresses the United States Department of Education’s Dual Capacity Building Framework for Family-School Partnerships in several ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linked to Learning: FAST for all kindergartners has a graduation after eight weekly 2.5 hour group sessions offered at school; monthly meetings led by parent graduates include working with second grade teachers to co-create family nights to support reading, writing, math and science.</li>
                <li>Relational: FAST aims to increase self-efficacy for all K-2 parents, strengthen parent-child bonds, family cohesion, parent to parent friendships of same aged children, and build parent-school-community local networks with a collective voice to reduce education disparities.</li>
                <li>Developmental: Weekly group sessions build connections and practice positive parenting; parent graduates are supported over two years to lead FAST and co-create educational opportunities for all K-2 families.</li>
                <li>Collective/Collaborative: Weekly and then monthly multi-family group meetings for families (10 per ‘hub’ group; 10 hubs=100 families) enable connections to develop a collective voice. FAST has a track record in 18 countries for high retention of low-income parents.</li>
                <li>Interactive: teams coach parents to lead family activities to increase learning readiness with experiential education.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Research Questions:</span> Does offering FAST to all kindergartners in low-income communities increase family engagement? Does FAST shift the school climate towards a norm of family engagement? Does participation in FAST increase motivated learning, enhanced well-being, and third grade reading scores?
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Sample:</span> Sixty elementary schools in The School District of Philadelphia.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Methods:</span> Randomized controlled trial of 60 low performing schools, with a focus on 3,000 K-2 children attending FAST-now vs. FAST-later, with outcomes including reading and mathematics achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Results:</span> First year implementation results show on average 18 kindergarten families per school participated in a FAST event; 80% returned for a second event.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Significance:</span> Strategic family engagement recognizes strengths of all parents, respects and empowers parents, is a wholistic approach, and builds relationships within families, across families and with schools and communities in urban schools. Randomized controlled trials have shown FAST impact on school performance and reading. United Nations recognizes FAST as an effective family skills program in schools with strong quality assurance structures.
