            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Theoretical Framework:</span> FAST groups are based on 10 theories from sociology and psychology and on Friere’s (1954) strategy of empowering a collective parent voice. FAST expresses the USDE’s Dual Capacity-Building Framework for Family-School Partnerships:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linked to Learning: K-FAST for all kindergartners has a graduation after 8 weekly 2.5 hour group sessions offered at school; monthly meetings led by parent graduates include working with second grade teachers to co-create family nights: reading, writing, math and science.</li>
                <li>Relational: FAST aims to increase self-efficacy for all K-2 parents, strengthen parent-child bonds, family cohesion, parent to parent friendships of same aged children, and build parent-school-community local networks with a collective voice to reduce education disparities.</li>
                <li>Developmental: Weekly group sessions build connections and practice positive parenting; parent graduates are supported over 2 years  to lead K-FAST and co-create educational opportunities for all families K-2.</li>
                <li>Collective/Collaborative: Weekly and then monthly multi-family group meetings for all families (10 per ‘hub’ group; 10 hubs=100 families) enable connections to develop a collective voice. FAST has a track record in 20 countries for high retention of low-income parents.</li>
                <li>Interactive: Interactive: teams coach parents to lead family activities to increase learning readiness with experiential education.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Research Questions:</span> Does offering FAST to all kindergartners in low-income communities increase family engagement? Does FAST shift the school climate towards a norm of family engagement? Does participation in FAST increase motivated learning, enhanced well-being, student achievement, and third grade reading scores?  
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Sample:</span> Sixty elementary schools in one urban school district.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Methods:</span> Randomized controlled trial of Title I schools; assessment reading and mathematics data from 3000 K-2 children attending FAST-now vs. FAST-later schools. Program integrity checklists data are collected.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Results:</span> First year implementation study results show on average 18 kindergarten families per 30 schools participated in a FAST event; 80% returned for a second event.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold-it">Significance:</span> FAST family engagement opportunities recognize strengths of all parents, respect and empower socially marginalized parents, use a holistic family approach, and build relationships within families, across families and schools and communities in poor communities. United Nations recognizes FAST as an effective family skills program with high retention and strong quality assurance structures.
