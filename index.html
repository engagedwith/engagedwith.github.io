        <h1>Hello, AERA!</h1>
        <p class="jumbo-group">Since 2010, the U.S. Department of Education (DoE) has been funding Investing in Innovation (i3) grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) and non-profits partnering with LEAs. The DoE defines innovation as, “A process, product, strategy, or practice that improves (or is expected to improve) significantly upon the outcomes reached with status quo options and that can ultimately reach widespread effective usage.” Several of these grants have identified family engagement as their absolute priority or include a substantial family engagement component. These highly competitive grants have focused on developing and validating innovative programs and practices to strengthen opportunities for marginalized families to be engaged in their children’s education. </p>
        <p class="jumbo-group">This AERA symposium highlights key lessons and impacts from four of these grants.</p>
