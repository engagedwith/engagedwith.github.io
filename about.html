              Improving schools and school systems works best when the people who are closest to the system have a strong voice. This website will feature research and stories about how families, students, teachers, and community members actively engage in achieving educational equity. Learn about factors that make it possible for diverse stakeholders to engage, draw lessons from challenges, and see the impact of deep engagement.
