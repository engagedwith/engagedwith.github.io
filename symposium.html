              This symposium shares outcomes and implementation lessons from mixed methods evaluations of four i3 grants, awarded in 2011 and 2012. They include:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>PTA Comunitario (Grantee: Intercultural Development Research Association, Texas)</li>
              <li>We Are A Village (Grantee: Central Falls, Rhode Island School District)</li>
              <li>Midwest Expansion of the Child-Parent Center Education Program, Preschool to Third Grade (Grantee: University of Minnesota)</li>
              <li>Families and Schools Together: An Innovative, Targeted Strategy for Removing Key Barriers to School Turnaround (Grantee: University of Wisconsin)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The first two of these grants are “development” grants, intended to support new or substantially more effective practices for addressing widely shared challenges. The latter two are “validation” grants, which support expansion of projects with moderate evidence of effectiveness, with particular focus on the populations for and the contexts in which the practice is most effective.

              By bringing together scholars and practitioners, this symposium offers the field of family/school/community partnerships critical lessons for both research and practice. This session is particularly timely following the release of the DoE’s <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/documents/family-community/partners-education.pdf">Dual Capacity-Building Framework for Family-School Partnerships.</a> This research-based framework identifies the capacities both families and staff need to support student achievement and school improvement, as well as the conditions and policy and program goals that lead to these outcomes. In addition to sharing the student-, parent-, school-, and community-level outcomes that accrue from building parent and staff capacities for rich partnership, presenters will deepen practical understanding of how to apply this framework among diverse populations in urban and rural areas throughout different regions on the country. Presenters will also share innovative strategies for using mixed methods to measure family engagement and evaluate associated conditions and outcomes.
